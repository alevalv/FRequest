FRequest v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------------
Description:
----------------------------------

FRequest is a fast, lightweight and opensource Windows / MacOS desktop program to make HTTP(s) requests (e.g. call REST apis). 

The main motivation for the program is to create a similar working software to an IDE but for HTTP(s) apis. It should be fast, 
cross platform, lightweight, practical with a native look. Also it is important that project files can be 
easily shared and work seamless with Source Code Management (SCM) for collaborative work.

The current features of FRequest are:

- Make GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / PATCH / HEAD / TRACE / OPTIONS HTTP(s) requests
- Make HTTP requests with RAW / Form Data or X-Form-WWW-UrlEncoded body types
- Analyse the request response body and headers
- Requests are contained in a project, this project is then saved in XML file on user's desired location
- Ability to override a project main url, so you can make requests to different domain name addresses within the same project
- Ability to download files from the requests
- Automatically beautify and provide syntax highlighting for JSON
- The FRequest project files are stored in a way which allow easy collaboration via a SCM like Git, Svn or Team Foundation Server
- Ability to add any kind of custom HTTP headers to the requests (automatically by taking the type in account or manually)
- Network proxy support
